### 1. **Introduction to Variables**

#### **What are Variables?**
In programming, a **variable** is essentially a storage location in memory, which is identified by a name and holds a value. The value stored in a variable can be of different types (e.g., integer, string, boolean), and it can change throughout the program as needed.

In Java, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated. When you define a variable, you associate a data type with it, and the variable will hold a value of that type.

#### **Variable Naming Rules & Conventions**

**1. Variable Naming Rules:**
- **Start with a letter, underscore (`_`), or dollar sign (`$`)**:
    - Valid: `myVariable`, `_myVar`, `$temp`
    - Invalid: `1variable` (can't start with a number)

- **Subsequent characters**: You can use letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs after the first character.
    - Valid: `my_var1`, `temp$`

- **No spaces**: You cannot have spaces in variable names.
    - Valid: `userAge`
    - Invalid: `user Age`

- **Case-sensitive**: Java is case-sensitive, so `myVariable` and `myvariable` are different.

- **No Java reserved keywords**: Keywords like `int`, `class`, `public` cannot be used as variable names.
    - Invalid: `int`, `public`, `class`

**2. Naming Conventions:**
- **Camel Case**: The most common convention in Java is to use *camelCase* for variable names. The first word starts with a lowercase letter, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.
    - Example: `userAge`, `totalAmount`, `numberOfStudents`

- **Meaningful Names**: Variables should have descriptive names to make the code more readable.
    - Example: `totalAmount` is better than just `x`.

- **Avoid Single Characters**: Unless in short loops or mathematical operations, try to avoid single-character variable names.
    - Bad: `x`, `y`
    - Good: `width`, `height`

#### **Declaring and Initializing Variables**

In Java, you **declare** a variable by specifying its data type and a name. You can **initialize** a variable by assigning it a value.

**1. Declaration:**
```java
int age; // Declares a variable of type 'int' named 'age'
```

**2. Initialization:**
```java
age = 25; // Initializes the 'age' variable with the value 25
```

**3. Declaration and Initialization together:**
```java
int age = 25; // Declares and initializes the 'age' variable with the value 25
```

Java supports various data types for variables:
- **Primitive Types** (e.g., `int`, `char`, `boolean`, `double`)
- **Reference Types** (e.g., `String`, arrays, objects)

Examples:
```java
int count = 10;          // Integer variable
double price = 19.99;    // Double variable
String name = "John";    // String variable
boolean isActive = true; // Boolean variable
```

#### **Scope of Variables**

The **scope** of a variable refers to where in the code it can be accessed. In Java, there are three main types of variable scopes:

1. **Local Variables**:
    - Local variables are declared inside a method, constructor, or block, and they can only be used within that method/block.
    - Example:
      ```java
      public void exampleMethod() {
          int localVariable = 10; // Local variable
          System.out.println(localVariable); // Accessible here
      }
      // localVariable cannot be accessed outside the method
      ```

2. **Instance Variables**:
    - Instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. They belong to instances (objects) of the class.
    - Instance variables can be accessed by any method in the class, and each object of the class has its own copy of the instance variables.
    - Example:
      ```java
      public class Person {
          String name; // Instance variable
          int age;     // Instance variable
          
          public void setName(String name) {
              this.name = name; // Using instance variable
          }
      }
      ```

3. **Static Variables**:
    - Static variables are declared with the `static` keyword and belong to the class, rather than to any specific instance (object) of the class. All objects of the class share the same static variable.
    - Example:
      ```java
      public class Counter {
          static int count = 0; // Static variable
          
          public void increment() {
              count++; // Shared by all instances
          }
      }
      ```

    - **Difference between Instance and Static Variables**:
        - **Instance Variables**: Different for each object; they store object-specific data.
        - **Static Variables**: Shared among all instances of the class; they store class-level data.

#### **Usage Examples**

1. **Local Variable Example**:
   ```java
   public void calculateSum() {
       int sum = 0; // Local variable
       for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
           sum += i;
       }
       System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum); // Local variable 'sum' can be used here
   }
   ```

2. **Instance Variable Example**:
   ```java
   public class Car {
       String color; // Instance variable
       int speed;    // Instance variable

       public void setSpeed(int speed) {
           this.speed = speed; // Set the instance variable
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Static Variable Example**:
   ```java
   public class Student {
       static int totalStudents = 0; // Static variable

       public Student() {
           totalStudents++; // Increment the class-level counter
       }

       public static void printTotalStudents() {
           System.out.println("Total students: " + totalStudents);
       }
   }
   ```

### **Summary**
- **Variables** are fundamental to programming and are used to store and manipulate data.
- **Naming Rules**: Follow conventions such as camelCase and avoid using reserved keywords.
- **Declaring and Initializing**: Declare with a type and name, and optionally initialize with a value.
- **Scope**: Variables can be **local**, **instance**, or **static**, with each having its specific scope and use cases.

Understanding variables and their scope is essential as you build your Java skills.
